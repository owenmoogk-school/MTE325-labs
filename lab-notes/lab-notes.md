## Session 1

In this session, we're initializing our project with a new git repo, and following the configuration steps.

### Getting started
We connected the limit switch to PB4, and ground. Then, we configured it to be a pullup high, and outputted the result to serial. This way we could output the read value and verify that the circuit works.

Next, we used pin PC7 and ground, through a potentiometer, to light up and LED with a GPIO pin.
